# Docker – Introduction

This repository contains my **learning notes and basic experiments with Docker**.
It is meant to capture **what Docker is**, **what it does**, and **why it is useful**, without overcomplicating things.

---

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows you to **package an application along with its dependencies** into a lightweight unit called a **container**.

A container runs the same way across different environments — local machine, server, or cloud.

In simple terms, Docker helps ensure:

> *If it works here, it will work everywhere.*

---

## What Does Docker Do?

Docker:

* Creates isolated environments using containers
* Packages application code, libraries, and runtime together
* Makes applications easy to run, stop, and move between systems

This removes the need for manual environment setup every time.

---

## What Problem Does Docker Solve?

Before Docker:

* Applications behaved differently across machines
* Dependency and version conflicts were common
* Setup instructions were long and error‑prone

Docker solves this by:

* Providing **consistent environments**
* Improving **portability** of applications
* Reducing setup and deployment issues

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This repo is used to:

* Learn Docker fundamentals
* Understand container concepts
* Practice basic Docker commands and workflows

It is focused on **learning and understanding**, not production usage.

---

## Scope

* Introductory Docker concepts
* Basic container usage
* Foundation for Docker Compose and Kubernetes

---

## Learning Status

This repository will evolve as I continue learning Docker and applying it alongside other tools like Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
